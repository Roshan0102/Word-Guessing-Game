**Title: Word Guessing Game**

**Description:**
The Word Guessing Game is an interactive and challenging web-based word game that tests your vocabulary and deduction skills. In this game, you are presented with a hidden word that you need to guess letter by letter. The game provides you with a limited number of attempts, adding an element of strategy and excitement to the experience.

**How to Play:**
1. When you start the game, you'll see a display area showing the hidden word as a series of underscore (_) characters, representing the letters that you need to guess.
2. Below the word display, you'll find a life counter showing the number of attempts remaining. You start with a set number of lives.
3. Enter a letter in the input box provided and click the "Guess" button or press the "Enter" key to submit your guess.
4. If your guessed letter is correct and is present in the hidden word, the corresponding underscore(s) will be replaced with the correct letter in the word display.
5. If your guessed letter is incorrect, your remaining life count will decrease, and you'll get closer to losing the game.
6. The game continues until you either successfully guess all the letters in the hidden word or you run out of lives.
